**QuiXProc** is an open source implementation of **XProc**. We want QuiXProc to become a mainstream tool to process **Structured** and **Unstructured Data**, preserving high quality, high throughput, and low resources consumption.



## The Purpose (Mission) ##

  * **Keep it standard**: we are close to implements full [W3C XProc standard](http://w3.org/TR/xproc)
  * **Keep it open**: we will disclose the source with GPL
  * **Provide services**: we will provides customization, training, support and optimization services
  * **Release often**: we want our user base to have regular updates of the code base

## How to ##
If you want to have access to **QuiXProc**:

### Lazy Way ###
Go to the [QuiXProc website](http://www.quixproc.com/quix/home) and [register](http://www.quixproc.com/quix/info?type=register) to have access to Innovimax's compilation Services. Note that the QuiXProc compilation services (QuiXProc Pro and QuiXProc Free) are improved version of QuiXProc Open.

### Detailled Way ###

See [Documentation#Detailled\_Way](Documentation#Detailled_Way.md)

## Getting Started and Documentation ##
See [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md) page, to have a quick test to start

You can also use the XProc Test Suite that you can find at http://tests.xproc.org

**More details in the [Documentation](Documentation.md) page**

## Troubleshooting ##
if you have a problem, first check that it's not an XML problem
To do that open your XPL pipeline in your favorite XML tools ([OxygenXML](http://oxygenxml.com) is very good for that)

If it's an [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) or an [XPath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) problem and you don't find the answer, please send an email on [XML-DEV](http://www.xml.org/xml-dev/)

If it's not an XML problem but an [XProc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XProc) problem, please send an email on [XPROC-DEV](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/)

If it's neither of those, then you certainly find a bug or a limitation, and hence you can send it either to [QUIXPROC](http://groups.google.com/group/quixproc) or [XPROC-DEV](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/) mailing lists

For any other questions see the [FAQ](FAQ.md)
