# Troubleshooting
if you have a problem, first check that it's not an XML problem
To do that open your XPL pipeline in your favorite XML tools ([http://oxygenxml.com OxygenXML] is very good for that)

If it's an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML] or an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath XPath] problem and you don't find the answer, please send an email on [http://www.xml.org/xml-dev/ XML-DEV]

If it's not an XML problem but an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XProc XProc] problem, please send an email on [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/ XPROC-DEV]

If it's neither of those, then you certainly find a bug or a limitation, and hence you can send it either to [http://groups.google.com/group/quixproc QUIXPROC] or [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/ XPROC-DEV] mailing lists
